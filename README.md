# edison-2019

The central repository for the L&amp;N STEMpunks Rookie Training in the 2019-2020 year.

## Introduction

Welcome to the L&N STEMpunks Programming Team! 

I am so happy that you decided to join! This repository will be the nexus all of us work from. 

A few notes:

- I will try to be as hands-off as I can be. In my experience, people learn programming faster when they code, not when they have to sit through hours of lectures/presentations. I will try to keep that to a minimum.
- If you want, this can be a self-paced course. I won't stop you from going as slow or as fast as you want. I understand that you have school and other activities.
- If you have any trouble and need help, and I mean ANY, don't hesitate to come to me or to Jackson. (@Tyler or @Jackson on Slack)

## Organization of Course


This will be a project-based course, meaning you will learn the skills necessary to complete a project (basically, a unit). There are five main projects in this course.

- Reading Your Computer's Stats (Basic Python)
- Build an Abstract Robot (Objects)
- Build a Basic Robot (RobotPy)
- Build a Normal Robot (Project Structure, Robot Frameworks)
- Build a Complex Robot (PID, Sensors, Vision)
